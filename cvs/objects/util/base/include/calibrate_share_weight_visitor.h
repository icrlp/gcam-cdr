 * \brief A visitor which determines if a logit nest has calibrated values
 *        and will adjust share weights algebraically to reproduce those values
 *        at the current set of prices.
 * \details For both subectors and technologies we first sum all of the calibration
 *          values and find the largest child in terms of largest calibration value
 *          so that we may make the share weights relative to that subsector/technology.
 *          We then back out the appropriate share weight to reproduce the calibration shares.
 *          This visitor relies on the discrete choice function to invert to logit
 *          formulation to back out the share weight so as to be flexible to which
 *          ever formulation is used.

 * \warning This class never actually checks whether calibration is active.
 * \warning This methodology will not work if in a given nest there is a mix
 *          of subsectors/technologies with and without calibrated values.
