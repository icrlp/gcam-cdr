# gcamdata XML inputs

This folder contains:
* a ZIP file that includes all of the XML files from the `input/gcamdata/xml` folder in GCAM 5.4, copied from JGCRI's release of that model
* XML input files specific to GCAM-CDR

If you are incorporating GCAM-CDR into an existing installation of GCAM 5.4, you can simply copy all of the non-zipped XML files into the `input/gcamdata/xml` folder of your GCAM 5.4 installation. You will also need to copy the `input/policy/CDR` folder into your installation, and it is recommended that you copy the file from the `input/solution` folder into your installation, as well.

If you have downloaded this directory as part of a standalone installation of GCAM-CDR, you will need to unzip the `GCAM-5.4_gcamdataXML.zip`  file and put all of its contents in this folder (`input/gcamdata/xml`).
