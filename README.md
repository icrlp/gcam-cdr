# GGCAM-CDR: A Variant of the Global Change Analysis Model-CDR

This software, GCAM-CDR, is a variant of the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM). 
GCAM is an integrated assessment model for studying climate policy. GCAM-CDR 
enhances GCAM's capacity to model carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and related policies.

GCAM-CDR was produced by the [Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy](https://www.american.edu/sis/centers/carbon-removal/) 
at American University, based on GCAM 5.4. For documentation on GCAM-CDR, 
see the [/docs](./docs) folder in the Github repository.

For documentation on GCAM, which is developed and maintained by the 
Joint Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI), 
see [http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/](http://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/)


The development of GCAM-CDR was supported by a grant from the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org).
